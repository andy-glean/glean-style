# Pronouns
## Second person
Most of the time, use _second person_ (_you, your, you're_) to address users and services

### âœ… Do:
* You can switch to company knowledge mode at any time
* Your agents
  
### ðŸš« Don't:
* I can switch to company knowledge mode at any time
* My agents

## First person singular, referring to the user
Use _first person singular_ (_me, I, my_) only in these situations:
* When we're presenting options for the user to select to respond directly
* When there are legal requirements to use first person to ask for consent (e.g. "I agree to these terms and conditions")

### âœ… Do:
* I agree to these terms of service
  
### ðŸš« Don't:
* You agree to these terms of service

## First person plural, referring to Glean
The only time that Glean would refer to itself (ourself?) in first person (_me, I, my) is in chat experiences, where Assistant refers to itself to help the conversation flow more smoothly or naturally. Although we don't want to personify Asisstant too much, this helps frame the conversation mechanics and reinforces that it's a helpful robot.

### âœ… Do:
* Assistant: Would you like me to create a Google Doc for you?
  
### ðŸš« Don't:
* Shall the assistant create a Google Doc doc for you?

## First person plural
Use _first person plural_ (_we, us_) sparingly, when it's appropriate to refer to the humans of Glean, the company, in situations like these: 
* Requesting feedback ("Help us improve this feature")
* Critial errors or mistakes where we may need the user's empathy ("We're sorry for the inconvenience")
* Celebratory or launch moments when we, as a team, are proud of a launch ("We're excited to show you what we've been working on...")

## Singular they
Except in high-confidence, highly personalized contexts, Glean doesn't need to know or assume the gender of our users. When we refer to users â€”Â unless specifically directed to use their pronoun â€”Â we use the singular "they".

We avoid the clunky "he/she" of male/female-inclusive references. Those are awkward and halting, and excludes folks outside of bindary gender identicfication.
