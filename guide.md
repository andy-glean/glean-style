# Glean product writing style guide

These guidelines apply to text in U.S. English, our source language for writing in-product content. Defer to component-level style guidance when needed, and keep in mind that in-product language is internationalized according to specific locale standards and style.

## Active and passive voice
Use active voice in most cases, and use passive voice sparingly.

* With **active voice**, sentences are simpler, shorter, clearer, and more conversational
* With **passive voice**, you can soften and provide distance in select situations (e.g., notifications of a disabled account).

### Active voice
In an active sentence, itâ€™s clear whoâ€™s doing what. The actor is the subject, and the subject of the sentence is doing something. 

âœ… Cindy Chang resolved your comment

### Passive voice
At times, active voice can come across too harshly. In these cases, use passive voice. This separates the actor from the action enough to soften a sentence. In a passive sentence, action is being taken upon the subject.

âœ… Your payment has been declined

ðŸš« We declined your payment

## Contractions
Use contractions to sound more conversational and natural.

### Common contractions
Use commonly understood contractions to keep sentences from feeling rigid, robotic, or overly formal.

Some common contractions:

* What's
* We'll
* You'll
* You'reYou've
* We're
* They're
* Doesn't
* Didn't
* Isn't
* Aren't
* Can't

### âœ… Do:
* If you can't
* You aren't connected
* This app isn't available

### ðŸš« Don't:
* If you cannot
* You are not connected
* This app is not available

### Contraction considerations
* Avoid contracting nouns with _is_, _does_, _has_, or _was_. This might make it look like the noun is possessive.
* Donâ€™t use uncommon or old-fashioned contractions (e.g., _wouldâ€™ve_ or _tweren't_).
* Donâ€™t use colloquial and regional contractions (e.g., _ain't_, _y'all_, _yinz_).
* Be mindful of how many contractions you use in a sentence. Too many contractions can make things difficult to read.
* Avoid using contractions when dealing with legal concerns, payment processing, and account security. Casual isnâ€™t always the best style when handling sensitive information.
