# Active and passive voice
Use active voice in most cases, and use passive voice sparingly.

* With **active voice**, sentences are simpler, shorter, clearer, and more conversational
* With **passive voice**, you can soften and provide distance in select situations (e.g., notifications of a disabled account).

## Active voice
In an active sentence, itâ€™s clear whoâ€™s doing what. The actor is the subject, and the subject of the sentence is doing something.

## Passive voice
At times, active voice can come across too harshly. In these cases, use passive voice. This separates the actor from the action enough to soften a sentence. In a passive sentence, action is being taken upon the subject.
