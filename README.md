## In-progress home for a product writing styleguide for Glean

Hi Gleanies! As Glean's content designer, I am ultimately responsible for the way we write in the product. Microcopy, dialog boxes, error messages, taxonomies, and even terms. Because I am a team of one and need to scale my work, I'll be documenting common patterns and styles that make up that writing. If you're a designer, engineer, PM, PMM, or someone whose writing shows up in product interfaces, please check this out! And I'd love to hear from you:Â 
* What do you want to see here?
* Does something you see here not work for your needs?

Please get in touch! I'm @andy on Slack or andy.welfle@glean.com.
